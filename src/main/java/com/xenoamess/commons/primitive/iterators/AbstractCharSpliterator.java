/**
 * An abstract {@code CharSpliterator.CharOfCharacter} that implements
 * {@code trySplit} to permit limited parallelism.
 *
 * <p>To implement a spliterator an extending class need only
 * implement {@link #tryAdvance(java.util.function.CharConsumer)
 * tryAdvance}.  The extending class should override
 * {@link #forEachRemaining(java.util.function.CharConsumer) forEachRemaining}
 * if it can provide a more performant implementation.
 *
 * @author XenoAmess
 * @version 0.8.0
 * @apiNote This class is a useful aid for creating a spliterator when it is not
 * possible or difficult to efficiently partition elements in a manner
 * allowing balanced parallel computation.
 *
 * <p>An alternative to using this class, that also permits limited
 * parallelism, is to create a spliterator from an iterator
 * (see {@link #spliterator(java.util.CharIterator, long, int)}.
 * Depending on the circumstances using an iterator may be easier or more
 * convenient than extending this class. For example, if there is already an
 * iterator available to use then there is no need to extend this class.
 * @see #spliterator(java.util.CharIterator, long, int)
 * @since 1.8
